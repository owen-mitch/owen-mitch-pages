## Welcome to owenmit.ch

This is a personal website created for and by Owen Mitchell. So far this is just a small passion project of mine, but I have a few ideas on what to put here. If you have any suggestions, get in touch with me via any of the contact methods in [Contact](#contact).

### Who are you?

I am a freelance programmer and soon-to-be comp sci student at Saint Joseph's University. I'm a regular gamer, occasional basketball player, and okay-ish guitar player. My employment is currently in a field unrelated to computer science, so all projects are done in my free time outside of school and work. Here are some things I've done/am working on:



#### Completed Projects

- Created home server running on headless ubuntu server install, used for personal media storage and backups.

#### In Development

- Stock analysis program that provides recommendations based on alternative data like social media sentiment.

### Socials
